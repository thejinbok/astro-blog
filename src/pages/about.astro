    <h2>... and my new Astro blog!</h2>

    <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>

    <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>

    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
        <li>I'm currently living in {identity.country}, and I work as a {identity.occupations[Math.floor(Math.random()*identity.occupations.length)]}.</li>
        {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
            <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]} and {identity.hobbies[1]}.</li>
        }
    </ul>
    <p>Some of my skills may or may not be the following:</p>
    <ul>
        {identity.skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>

    <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>
